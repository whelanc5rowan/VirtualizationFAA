Guys... specs document is done and 
we are up and running with slack, 
groupMe, googleDocs, and gitHub!! 
We are doing well..  
I expect us to have another meeting on wednesday morning 
around 10am-11am with Andrew and then meeting for at least 1 hour 
during normal lecture time in whichever room we can use.
